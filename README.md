# DinnerShop
Spring boot + SpringMVC + SpringSecurity+ Thymeleaf + Java8 + Flyway + H2db
This opensource project presents an online shop where you can buy meals. It is still in its development phase, so feel free to open issues, fork repository and change whatever you want. 
Soon a life preview will be available, but for now you can copy repository to your local environment and simply use maven to build an executable jar file. Please be aware that Java8 is mandatory.
